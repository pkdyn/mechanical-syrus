 There is as much cruelty in pardoning all, as in pardoning none		
 He lays up his treasure in a sepulcher who makes an old man his heir		
 It is a less evil to be unable to live than not to know how to live		
 A sentence to death is more tolerable than a command to live wickedly		
 An evil conscience is often quiet, but never secure		
 Away from your country, though in the midst of friends, you long to return thither again		
 When the dog is too old you cannot get him used to the collar		
 Man's life is short; and therefore an honorable death is his immortality
